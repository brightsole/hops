# hops

## TODO
- validate **query** thoroughly
- set up postman setup files for this service that use the url
  - make it get words from real service
- make sure it deploys ok
- backport the hop string representation into its nice user-useable variant
- thoroughly test attemptHop
- validate our tests, the resolvers and integration tests were **heavy** ai
- think of a smarter way to do batch deletes (a user clicking 'restart' before succeeding)
  - alternatively, just delete them
